# Grapher
A simple graphing tool that uses math.js to evaluate and plot mathmatical expressions.

## Instructions
- Head over to https://pixeltomato.github.io/grapher/ to start graphing.
- Type in an expression in terms of x. Most should work fine. If not, try a different expression.
- Putting `f(x)` in front of expressions will break the grapher. You don't need to name your function.
